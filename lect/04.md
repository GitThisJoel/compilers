## Equivalent grammar 

Two grammars, G1 and G2, are equivalent if they generate the same language.
I.e., a sentence can be derived from one of the grammars,
iff it can be derived also from the other grammar:

```
L(G1) = L(G2)
```

## Common kinds of ambiguities

- Binary operatiors with different priorities: `a + b * c == d, ...`
- Associativity of binary operators of the same priority: `a + b - c + d,`
- Dangling else: 

```
if (a)
if (b) c = d;
else e = f;
```
