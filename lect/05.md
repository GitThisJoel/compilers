## Algo for constructing a LL parsing

- FIRST - set of tokens
- Nullable - boolean 
- FOLLOW - set of tokens

### Example 

```
p1: statement    -> assigment
p2: statement    -> compoundStmt
p3: assignment   -> ID "=" expr ";"
p4: compoundStmt -> "{" statements "}" 
p5: statements   -> statement statements 
p6: statements   -> epsilon
```

|              | ID  | "=" | ";" | "{" | "}" |
| ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| statement    | p1  |     |     | p2  |     |
| assignment   | p3  |     |     |     |     |
| compiundStmt |     |     |     | p4  |     |
| satements    | p5  |     |     | p5  | p6  |


### Example 

```
p0: S -> varDecl $
p1: varDecl -> type ID optInit
p2: type -> "integer" 
p3: type -> "boolean" 
p4: optInit -> "=" Int
p5: optInit -> epsilon
```

|         | ID  | integer | boolean | "=" | ";" | INT | $   |
| ------- | --- | ------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S       |     | p0      | p0      |     |     |     |     |
| varDecl |     | p1      | p1      |     |     |     |     |
| type    |     | p2      | p3      | p4  |     |     |     |
| optInit |     |         |         |     |     |     | p5  |


### Example

```
p1: E -> E "*" F
p2: E -> F
p3: F -> ID
p4: F -> INT
```

|     | "*" | ID    | INT   |
| --- | --- | ----- | ----- |
| E   |     | p1,p2 | p1,p2 |
| F   |     | p3    | p4    |

### Example

```
p1: E -> F "*" E
p2: E -> F
p3: F -> ID
p4: F -> INT
p5: F -> "(" E ")"
```

|     | "*" | ID    | INT   | "("   | ")" |
| --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| E   |     | p1,p2 | p1,p2 | p1,p2 |     |
| F   |     | p3    | p4    | p5    |     |

### Exercise: what is Nullable(X)?

```
Z -> d
Z -> X Y Z
Y -> e
Y -> c
X -> Y
X -> a
```

|     | Nullable |
| --- | -------- |
| X   | T        |
| Y   | T        |
| Z   | F        |

### Exercise: compute Nullable(X)

If somthing changed at an iteration, a new iteration is needed.
